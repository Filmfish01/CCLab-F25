                The Negativecilla has only been observed once but given it was observed in open space one little is know about where
                originates from, the most likely explination is that it originates from a planet like most life but the scientific
                community still is in debate, because if this creature did orinate from a planet then its negative mass core would
                instantly kill it as soon as it expienced signigican gravitational force. A nother explination given is that these creatures
                consume the mass when they leave their host planet and then spend their "adult lives" in space feeding on the dark energy
                over centuries. Alot is still unknow about how it eats but it does seem to be feeding on some kind of mass, Plankteia
                the scientist who discovered the cell was testing if negaitve mass interacted with dark matter and suspects that its digestion
                is somehow able to interact with it, but much has yet to be tested and seen.

                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Negative mass is difficult to move,
                to make it move in the direction you want you must push it and if it is already moving in the desired direction you cant apply this 
                force at the same angle as that simply nullifies the Negative mass momentum as it apposes motion.
